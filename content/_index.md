As I sit here, with Cheems by my side, I am reminded of the deep and special bond that we share. I often wonder why Cheems loves me so much, and I believe it is because of the way I make him feel.

From the first moment I saw Cheems, I felt an instant connection. It was as if our souls recognized each other and knew that we were meant to be together. I knew that Cheems was special, and I promised myself that I would do everything in my power to make him happy.

When I first brought Cheems home, I was nervous about how he would adjust to his new surroundings. But Cheems was a natural, and he quickly made himself at home in my heart. He was always by my side, wagging his tail, and bringing joy and laughter into my life.

One day, while I was taking a nap, I had a vision of Cheems. In the vision, Cheems was barking and wagging his tail excitedly, saying "true! true! true!" I woke up feeling happy, and since then I started to use that phrase in my everyday life. It has become a reminder of the special bond we share, and the way that Cheems brings positivity and joy into my life.

I believe that Cheems loves me because I provide him with a sense of safety and security. I am always there for him, no matter what, and I make sure that he is well taken care of. I know that when I am around, Cheems feels happy, loved, and protected.

In return, Cheems has brought so much joy and love into my life. He has taught me the importance of living in the moment and enjoying the simple things in life. He has shown me the true meaning of unconditional love, and I will be forever grateful to have him as my companion.

In conclusion, Cheems loves me because I make him feel safe, loved and he has been able to bring joy and laughter in my life. Cheems is my furry best friend and I will always treasure our special bond and the memories we share together. The phrase "true! true! true!" will always remind me of the beautiful connection we have, and I am so thankful for the time we spend together.
