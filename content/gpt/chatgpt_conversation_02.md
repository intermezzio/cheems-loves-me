### You
can you take this quiz and turn it into an html form with javascript that prints the result to the console?

### ChatGPT

Sure! Here is an HTML form version of the quiz with JavaScript that will print the result to the console:

```html
<form id="cheem-quiz">
  <h3>How much do you like cheems?</h3>
  <label for="q1">1. How often do you think about cheems?</label><br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="a"> Never<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="b"> Occasionally<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="c"> Often<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q1" value="d"> Constantly<br><br>
  
  <label for="q2">2. Have you ever owned a cheem?</label><br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="a"> No<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="b"> Yes, but it didn't work out<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="c"> Yes, and it was a great experience<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q2" value="d"> Yes, and it is still a beloved member of my family<br><br>
  
  <label for="q3">3. How do you feel when you see a cheem?</label><br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="a"> Indifferent<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="b"> Happy<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="c"> Excited<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q3" value="d"> Overwhelmed with love<br><br>
  
  <label for="q4">4. How do you react when someone mentions cheems in conversation?</label><br>
  <input type="radio" name="q4" value="a"> I don't pay attention<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q4" value="b"> I smile and listen<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q4" value="c"> I get excited and start talking about my own experiences with cheems<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q4" value="d"> I can't control my emotions and start crying tears of joy<br><br>
  
  <label for="q5">5. How much do you enjoy seeing pictures or videos of cheems on the internet?</label><br>
  <input type="radio" name="q5" value="a"> Not at all<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q5" value="b"> A little bit<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q5" value="c"> Moderately<br>
  <input type="radio" name="q5" value="d"> Extremely<br><br>
  
  <input type="button" value="Submit" onclick="scoreQuiz()">
</form>

<script>
function scoreQuiz() {
  var score = 0;
  var form = document.getElementById("cheem-quiz");
  
  for (var i

```

### You
Can you write the rest of the javascript for that form?

### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here is the rest of the JavaScript code to complete the quiz form:

```html
<script>
function scoreQuiz() {
  var score = 0;
  var form = document.getElementById("cheem-quiz");
  
  for (var i = 0; i < form.length; i++) {
    var input = form[i];
    if (input.type === "radio" && input.checked) {
      score += input.value === "a" ? 0 :
               input.value === "b" ? 1 :
               input.value === "c" ? 2 :
               input.value === "d" ? 3 :
               0;
    }
  }
  
  console.log("Your score: " + score);
}
</script>

```

This code will loop through all the form elements and check which radio buttons are checked. It will then add the corresponding score value (0, 1, 2, or 3) to the score variable. Finally, it will print the total score to the console.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

### You
Instead, can you print the result of the quiz in a div element?

### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here is the revised JavaScript code that will print the result of the quiz in a div element:

```html
<script>
function scoreQuiz() {
  var score = 0;
  var form = document.getElementById("cheem-quiz");
  
  for (var i = 0; i < form.length; i++) {
    var input = form[i];
    if (input.type === "radio" && input.checked) {
      score += input.value === "a" ? 0 :
               input.value === "b" ? 1 :
               input.value === "c" ? 2 :
               input.value === "d" ? 3 :
               0;
    }
  }
  
  var resultDiv = document.getElementById("result");
  resultDiv.innerHTML = "Your score: " + score;
}
</script>

```

To use this code, you will need to include a div element with the id of "result" somewhere in your HTML. The result of the quiz will be printed inside this div element.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

### You
Can you instead have the Javascript code tell the user how much they like cheems based on their score?

### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here is the revised JavaScript code that will print a message to the user based on their score:

```html
<script>
function scoreQuiz() {
  var score = 0;
  var form = document.getElementById("cheem-quiz");
  
  for (var i = 0; i < form.length; i++) {
    var input = form[i];
    if (input.type === "radio" && input.checked) {
      score += input.value === "a" ? 0 :
               input.value === "b" ? 1 :
               input.value === "c" ? 2 :
               input.value === "d" ? 3 :
               0;
    }
  }
  
  var resultDiv = document.getElementById("result");
  if (score === 0) {
    resultDiv.innerHTML = "You do not seem to like cheems very much.";
  } else if (score < 5) {
    resultDiv.innerHTML = "You have a moderate level of appreciation for cheems.";
  } else if (score < 10) {
    resultDiv.innerHTML = "You have a strong fondness for cheems.";
  } else {
    resultDiv.innerHTML = "You are obsessed with cheems!";
  }
}
</script>

```

To use this code, you will still need to include a div element with the id of "result" somewhere in your HTML. The message will be printed inside this div element.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions.

### You
Can you make the html quiz longer?

### ChatGPT

Certainly! Here is a longer version of the quiz with additional questions:

```html
