write a blog post about why I joined formula sae electric motorsports

Hello everyone! I wanted to share my experience joining Formula SAE Electric Motorsports and why I decided to get involved.

As someone who has always been passionate about engineering and electric vehicles, joining Formula SAE was a no-brainer for me. The opportunity to design and build a high-performance electric race car from the ground up was too good to pass up.

But what really drew me to Formula SAE was the chance to work with a team of like-minded individuals who are all striving for the same goal: to create the best electric race car possible. I love being part of a team where everyone brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table, and where we can all learn from each other.

In addition to the hands-on engineering experience, Formula SAE has also given me the opportunity to develop my leadership and teamwork skills. Being part of a project of this magnitude requires a lot of collaboration, communication, and problem-solving, and I have learned so much from working with my teammates.

Overall, joining Formula SAE Electric Motorsports has been an incredible experience that has allowed me to pursue my passions and grow as an engineer. I am excited to see where this journey takes me, and I am grateful to be a part of such an amazing team.

Thank you for reading, and I hope this gives you a glimpse into my experience with Formula SAE.
