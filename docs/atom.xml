&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! I wanted to share my experience joining Formula SAE Electric Motorsports and why I decided to get involved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As someone who has always been passionate about engineering and electric vehicles, joining Formula SAE was a no-brainer for me. The opportunity to design and build a high-performance electric race car from the ground up was too good to pass up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what really drew me to Formula SAE was the chance to work with a team of like-minded individuals who are all striving for the same goal: to create the best electric race car possible. I love being part of a team where everyone brings their own unique skills and perspectives to the table, and where we can all learn from each other.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to the hands-on engineering experience, Formula SAE has also given me the opportunity to develop my leadership and teamwork skills. Being part of a project of this magnitude requires a lot of collaboration, communication, and problem-solving, and I have learned so much from working with my teammates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, joining Formula SAE Electric Motorsports has been an incredible experience that has allowed me to pursue my passions and grow as an engineer. I am excited to see where this journey takes me, and I am grateful to be a part of such an amazing team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for reading, and I hope this gives you a glimpse into my experience with Formula SAE.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hello everyone! I wanted to share my experience interning at Tesla this past spring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the moment I arrived at the Tesla campus, I was struck by the energy and excitement of the people working there. As an intern, I was able to work on a variety of projects that allowed me to learn and grow both personally and professionally.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of my favorite projects was assisting with the development of a new feature for the Tesla app. It was amazing to see how my work directly impacted the end product and how it would be used by Tesla owners. I was also able to work on a research project examining the potential for solar panel installations on Tesla electric semi-trucks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to my work projects, Tesla also provided numerous learning and development opportunities for their interns. I had the chance to attend workshops on topics such as electric vehicle technology, sustainability, and company culture. I also had the opportunity to tour the Tesla factory, which was a truly once-in-a-lifetime experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Overall, my spring internship at Tesla was an incredible opportunity that I will always treasure. I am grateful to the Tesla team for their mentorship and support, and I can&amp;rsquo;t wait to see where my career takes me next.&lt;/p&gt;
